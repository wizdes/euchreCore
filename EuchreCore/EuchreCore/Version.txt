So create a new interface for Web. Waits on a property to be set, and then runs.
Web will set the property and kick out the wait.
Browser may need to refresh to see new values, or implement a wait.

Add a 'gamestate viewing' function.

Obviously, web sockets will be a much better experience.

We released a version of Hearts! It includes all the basic things like passing, counting cards, points assignment and even things like shooting the moon!
Missing: Rule enforcement, real AI, a useable interface, and command line selection for play card. 
Also: We can code UI at this point! All the data structures are there.
Note: We should add some tests.
